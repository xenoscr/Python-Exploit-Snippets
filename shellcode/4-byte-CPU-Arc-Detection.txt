"\x31\xC0\x40\x90\x0F\x84\x36\x04\x00\x00"

# This code is interpreted in x86 as:

31 c0                   xor    eax,eax
40                      inc    eax
90                      nop
0f 84 36 04 00 00       je     0x440

# On x64 it is interpreted as:

31 c0                   xor    eax,eax
40 90                   rex xchg eax,eax
0f 84 36 04 00 00       je     0x440

# Explanation: On the x86 version of the interpretation the ZF will not be set because the result of the previous instruction "inc eax"
# will be non-zero. On an x64 CPU, the ZF will be set because the result of exchanging eax (zero at the time) will be zero. The jump will
# be taken to the x64 shellcode.
